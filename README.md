# Anagrams
This is a solution to the Trustpilot coding challenge. Located http://followthewhiterabbit.trustpilot.com/cs/step3.html
This solution solves the the easy and the medium phrase in 3 about seconds, while the hard one is solved in 5 minutes.
Upgrades to make this solution better could be to use the NPM package cluster and do a queue implementation of the work.
This would only make a difference on multicore systems.

To run this application:
1. navigate to the root folder of the repository
2. npm i
3. node anagram.js

The console will then spit out the secret phrases.
You will need nodejs installed to run the application.
